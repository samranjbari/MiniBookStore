                        without limitation reasonable fees for attorneys and experts) arising out of any
                        claim, demand, cause of action, debt or liability, including reasonable attorneys’
                        fees, to the extent that such action is based upon or arises out of a claim that
                        (a) if true, would constitute a breach of any of your representations, warranties,
                        or agreements hereunder; (b) you have infringed on the intellectual property or
                        other rights of any third party; or (c) arises from any negligence or willful misconduct

                        and settlement of any claim or action with counsel of its own choosing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>14. MISCELLANEOUS</strong> You acknowledge and agree
                        that Company has the right to discontinue operation of the Website at any time in
                        its absolute and sole discretion. You further acknowledge and agree that Company
                        may assign the terms of this Agreement without prior notice to a successor entity
                        in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or part of Company’s business.
                        No waiver of any breach of this Agreement, no matter how long continuing or how
                        often repeated will be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach, nor shall any delay
                        or omission to exercise any right, power, or privilege hereunder be deemed a waiver
                        of such right, power, or privilege. You acknowledge that there shall be no modifications
                        to the terms and conditions of this Agreement without the prior written consent
                        of both Parties. If any section of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or
                        in conflict with the law of any jurisdiction, the validity of the remaining sections
                        shall not be affected by such holding. The meaning of the section shall be construed
                        to the extent feasible to render the paragraph enforceable and to give effect to
                        the intentions of you and Company as reflected in the Agreement. If no feasible
                        interpretation would save such Agreement, it is to be severed from the remaining
                        terms of this Agreement, which are to remain in full force and effect. This Agreement
                        constitutes the entire agreement between you and Company with respect to the subject
                        matter of this Agreement, and shall supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
                        if any, whether written or oral. The paragraph headings and subheadings contained
                        in this Agreement are included for convenience only and shall not limit or otherwise

                        is sought, the prevailing party shall be entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys’
                        fees. All claims that you bring against the Company or Website must be resolved
